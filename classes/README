Hello, below is a brief description of the current encryption system
- of course, further changes must be made to make it more secure
- it's suffice to say, that this is a prototype
- You are more than free to use and modify this in any way desired

- Sincerely, Aria.


How to use / understand

- To run the program and test - please run main.py
- To check validity of program - please run spn.py - there is a test-case

- This is a DIY Multi-layer bit-scrambler so far
- You supply two arbritary numberical keys - named K1 & K2
- K1 drives a per-bit-zero-padding stage - "pad1" - cycling through its digits
- K2 powers a per-round circular rotate stage - "pad2_rotate" - cycling * round index

- A custom 64-bit SPN block cipher ( XOR -> S-box -> P-layer -> Whitening ) adds non-linearly (*cough)
- Stream wrapper chops 7-bit ASCII into 64-bit chunks - encrypts then rejoins

- Every layer should be perfectly invertible for round-trip decryptibility

- Proof-of-concept, feel free to play around and message me for more information!



[*] Swapping AES-GCM / ChaCha20-Poly1305 - would allow for better crypto.
